# NLP_Assembly
Using the NLP techniques to generate Assembly codes to enable easier reach for assembly level programming.

## Overview
This code is a tool which can be used to program on assembly level using natural language. It accepts the input file in natural language and generates the output in .txt/.asm file.

## Dependencies
- Python-3
- CSV
- Input text file written in english

## Usage
Run python converter-v1.3.py < input text file> in terminal/cmd. The program performs conversion and asks for the folder to save the output file.

## Work to be done
Currently two features are to be added to this code viz.<br>
1. Register addressing modes
2. OS module which would specify the file extension for output file

## Optional upgrade
Use of Tkinter to add a UI to this code.
